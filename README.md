# Scores (seed)

A minimal Next.js (TypeScript) app as a clean slate for the Scores project.

## Dev

- Create `.env.local` as needed (kept out of git).
- Start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Notes

- Keep UI simple for now; focus on purpose and flow first.
- `SUMMARY.txt` and `.env.local` are ignored by git.
